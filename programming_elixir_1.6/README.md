## What is this?
This repo contains all the exercise source code from this book: [Programming Elixir â‰¥ 1.6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-elixir/9781680506129/). 
### Notes
If you stumble apon this repo, I will advise against reading this book if you already have some experience in professional programming. Some bridges are missing between multiple concepts, which makes those concept harder to understand. It might also be my failt, maybe my expectation is incorrect.
